							<h2>Statistical Research Assistant</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Utilised R and Python to perform sophisticated data cleaning, analysis, and visualization on over 10,000 data points, revealing critical ecological patterns and trends.</li>
								<li>Designed advanced ARIMA time-series models to predict marine plankton population trends, enhancing model precision by reducing Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion (AIC/BIC) scores by over 350 points compared to automatically fitted models.</li>
								<li>Created a correlation matrix using R to map the relationships between plankton types, and performed linear regression to accurately forecast their future interspecies population dynamics.</li>
								<li>Developed an interactive web application using R and Shiny (<a href="https://lswoboda.shinyapps.io/CorrMatrix/">Correlation and Linear Regression Analysis</a> and <a href="https://lswoboda.shinyapps.io/TimeSeries/">Time Series Analysis</a>) that facilitates user-driven exploration of plankton data, offering tools for correlation analysis, linear regression, and future trend forecasting through sophisticated time-series modeling.</li>
								<li>Collaborated with a multidisciplinary team consisting of faculty and students to integrate research findings into a new coursework module about the history and future of data (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AMeFnTMvHMZ7P7QNil5FylyqoJn1BFSd/view?usp=sharing">Statistical Report</a>).</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Password Strength Checker</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Utilised SHA-1 hashing to anonymize password data during API checks, accurately and safely identifying compromised passwords from a database of over 900 million unique entries.</li>
								<li>Automated the process of checking password security for large datasets by iterating through CSV files with 1000+ entries using Pandas, significantly reducing manual effort.</li>
								<li>Incorporated robust error handling mechanisms to manage API request failures, improving the script's reliability and user experience.</li>
								<li>Achieved efficient processing by splitting and checking password hashes in less than 0.5 seconds per entry.</li>
								<li>Designed the script to be user-friendly, allowing users to input file paths and receive immediate, actionable security feedback.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Web Scraper</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Created a web scraper using Python for Hacker News that automated the collection of top-tier posts from over 200 entries across multiple pages, ensuring only the most relevant content with external links and top votes are displayed.</li>
								<li>Utilised BeautifulSoup to parse HTML and extract relevant job posting information from Hacker News' monthly "who is hiring?" posts, ensuring accurate data retrieval from dynamic web content.</li>
								<li>Used the scraped data to identify and rank the most in-demand programming languages based on frequency of mentions, providing insights into current industry needs.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Image Classifier</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Developed a Python-based image classification system that enables users to input images and receive the top 5 predictions along with corresponding probabilities, providing insights into the likely subject of each image.</li>
								<li>Utilised Google's convolutional neural network Inceptionv3, capable of identifying objects in images with up to 97% accuracy.</li>
								<li>Automated the prediction process by integrating the classification code into a batch processing script, allowing the classification of hundreds of images in a single run.</li>
